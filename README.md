👋 Hi, I’m **@SanjayKankamwar**

👀 I’m passionate about **DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, CI/CD Pipelines**, and building scalable systems.

🌱 Currently exploring deeper into **Grafana Stack, Kubernetes (EKS), Jenkins**, and **cloud-native monitoring** tools.

💼 I've worked on projects involving:
- Full-stack **CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube, and Kubernetes
- **Cloud deployments** on AWS with secure credential management
- **Centralized logging & monitoring** using Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Grafana
- Resume sorting using **NLP, Flask**, and **MERN stack** with MongoDB

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **DevOps automation**, **cloud-native app deployment**, and **open source infrastructure tools**.

⚡ Fun fact: I built a production-ready DevOps pipeline from scratch that handles code checkout, scanning, testing, Dockerization, Kubernetes deployment, and sends build reports via email!
