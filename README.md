👋 Hi, I’m @SanjayKankamwar

👀 I’m passionate about DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, CI/CD Pipelines, Data Analytics, and building scalable systems that are secure, efficient, and production-ready.

🛠️ Experienced in:

Designing and maintaining end-to-end CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube, and Kubernetes

Deploying cloud-native applications on AWS, with focus on IAM, EC2, S3, and secure credential management

Implementing centralized logging and monitoring with Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Grafana

Building data analytics pipelines for log/metric analysis and interactive visualizations using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Grafana

Developing web systems with Flask, MongoDB, React, and Node.js, with applied NLP techniques for text-based applications
